Type the command:
>>CreateTumorDataSet
to create the spreadsheet "codedimagedataset.xlsx"

Then edit the spreadsheet to place "labels" in first row.

Note the first column of the generated data is the "desired response" corresponding
to the label of each tumor data file. The remaining columns are the "features" of the
tumor image.

Then use the "LinearMachine" or "Perceptron" to make
Predictions.
