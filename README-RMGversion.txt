NOTE THIS VERSION OF THE SOFTWARE USING ".MLX" files which are LIVE
MATLAB SCRIPTS. You need to OPEN these using the MATLAB Graphical
user interface and RUN them by using the GREEN RUN button on the Interface.

STEP 1: set your current MATLAB folder to: ACN5314
STEP 2: type in the command: >>updatesofwarepath
STEP 3: Typically at this point you will go into the folder called "RecodingDataSets" to prepare your data
STEP 4: Now change to the folder "LinearMachines" or "Perceptron"
STEP 5: Now use the "open" command from the MATLAB interface to open the ".mlx" file
STEP 6: Set the parameters
STEP 7: Hit the green RUN button on the interface
STEP 8: You will see "precision" and "recall" and other statistics for training and test data printed out!!!

WARNING!
If you are using the software folder "LinearMachines" then you must exit MATLAB
and then start up MATLAB again to clear the path if you want to switch
to "Perceptron".

Similarly, if you start using the "Perceptron" its best to exit MATLAB
and then start up MATLAB again to clear the path if you want to switch
the the "LinearMachines"
