IMPORTANT!!!!!
To ensure everything works correctly, it is
important that you setup the software path
so MATLAB can find the right function libraries.

To set up the software path, WHEN THE MATLAB CURRENT
DIRECTORY IS SET EQUAL TO THE CONTENTS OF THIS FOLDER type:
>>updatesoftwarepath;

If you get an error message then you are in the wrong folder!

THEN YOU CAN GO INTO FOLDER OF INTEREST
Then change the current directory to a folder of your choice
located in the relevant book chapter directory
using MATLAB GUI interface or the CD command.
